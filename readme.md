# Wordpress Custom Post Types and Taxonomies Plugin

It is best practice to include custom post types and taxonomies in a plugin, rather than in functions.php, and that's exactly what this plugin does. There is no UI -- just adjust the plugin code to suit your needs.

### Includes

custom-post-types-taxonomies.php, which contains examples for setting up a hierarchical taxonomy, a non-hierarchical taxonomy and a custom post type, including labels, dashicons, etc.

## How To Use

* Upload the Wordpress Custom Post Types and Taxonomies Plugin folder to your plugins directory.
* Activate plugin.
* Code away! Add, change and remove custom post types and taxonomies as needed.
